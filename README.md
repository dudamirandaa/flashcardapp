# Web Application Project

This project is a full-stack web application consisting of an Angular frontend, a Java Spring Boot backend, and a MySQL database. It was developed for the course **Project: Java and Web Development**, which is part of the Computer Science curriculum at IU International University.

## Project description

The Flashcard APP was developed with the purpose of supporting language learners who are actively expanding their vocabulary through interactive flashcards, which allow users to:
- review terms and their translations,
- see their use in sentences and
- see the grammatical article of nouns.

By creating, managing and organizing flashcards in folders and having separate spaces for different modes of study, the tool attempts to make language learning more systematic and manageable.

## Technology choices

The main purpose of the technology selections was to leverage the students' preexisting skills.
- MySQL was chosen for the database for being widely used and providing accessible resources for learning.
- Angular was selected for the SPA because of its component-based architecture, which simplifies dynamic content development.
- Java and the Spring Boot framework were chosen for the API because they provide robust support for HTTP requests, simple integration with MySQL, and platform independence through built-in server capabilities and reusable configurations.â€‹

## Installation and run instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
- [Java JDK 11 or above](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dudamirandaa/flashcardapp.git
```

### Database Setup

Import the sample SQL files provided:

1. Navigate to the database directory:
    ```bash
    cd flashcardapp/database-config
    ```

1. Create the database and tables:
    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p < create-tables.sql
    ```

2. Insert sample data:
    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p < sample-data.sql
    ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd flashcardapp/flashcardapp-backend
    ```

2. Configure the database connection in `application.properties`:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/flashcards?serverTimezone=Europe/Berlin
    spring.datasource.username=<yourusername>
    spring.datasource.password=<yourpassword>
    ```

3. Build and run the backend:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd flashcardapp/flashcardapp-frontend/angular-flashcardapp
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the Angular development server:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Running the Application

1. Ensure that MySQL is running.
2. Start the backend using the instructions above.
3. Start the frontend using the instructions above.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to access the application.
